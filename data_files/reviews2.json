I don't need a challenge I need a lot of fun. There are so many games to play I can't waste my time trying to get through levels much less spend money to do so."

        "review": "La película es muy buena, dentro de su género. La fluctuación entre diversos planos de la realidad, leitmotif de la neomodernidad cibernético-informática, aunque nos recuerda a Matrix y Avatar, se precipita inteligente pero vertiginosamente por la montaña rusa de la realidad virtual y los videojuegos, otra veta de la ficción (cuasi)posapocalíptica. Lo malo, para nosotros los clientes de Google Play (en Colombia, al menos), es que en esta página se afirma que tiene subtítulos en español, lo cual resulta falso una vez que comienzas a verla. Y, para rematar, los que sí tiene en inglés están desfasados como diez minutos. Conque... ¡a adivinar qué dicen los personajes! (¿O será esto parte de algún experimento cognitivo?)"

The movie is very entertaining and especially for those who grew up in the 70-80s, with familiar shows/games/anime depicted in the show. Thumbs up for this entertaining movie."
